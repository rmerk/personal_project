                p.
                    Future Epsilon cohort graduate of Prime Digital Academy.
                    During my time at Prime, I studied the MEAN Stack in-depth.
                    After graduation, I plan on devoting my free-time to learning
                    the intricacies of Angular.  #[br]#[br] If you're a Minnesota Developer

                p.
                    Prior to studying the MEAN stack, I spent much time learning
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  These technologies were a gateway drug
                    to my experimentation in the content management systems of
                    Drupal and Wordpress, which I have implemented in several sites.

                    During the fast escaping summer months in Minnesota, I like to vegetable garden.  I find it
                    very cathartic to get my hands dirty and nurture something from the early stages of life into its
                    final moments of existence.  Harvesting a large bounty that you can share with your friends
                    is also a bonus!
